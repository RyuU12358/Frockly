# Frockly

**Frockly** is a visual Excel formula builder powered by Blockly.

It lets you edit and refactor Excel formulas *structurally*,
instead of dealing with deeply nested text formulas.


You can build Excel formulas using blocks instead of typing,
with support for:

- Excel-compatible functions (SUM, IF, XLOOKUP, etc.)
- Variadic argument blocks
- Cell and range references
- Absolute reference toggles ($A$1, $A1, A$1)
- Japanese / English UI switching
