**Frockly** is a visual Excel formula builder powered by Blockly.

You can build Excel formulas using blocks instead of typing,
with support for:

- Excel-compatible functions (SUM, IF, XLOOKUP, etc.)
- Variadic argument blocks
- Cell and range references
- Absolute reference toggles ($A$1, $A1, A$1)
- Japanese / English UI switching
