# Frockly

Frockly is an experimental visual editor for Excel formulas.

Instead of reading and editing long, nested text formulas,
it represents formulas structurally using blocks.

This is an early experiment focused on readability and refactoring,
not a finished product.

## Example

Same formula, different representation.
